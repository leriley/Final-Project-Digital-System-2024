# Final Project Digital System 2024 - Creating Digital Art With Paint Tool Sai
Created by Lenore Riley  
- The purpose of this tutorial is to showcase settings and tools for creating digital art with Paint Tool Sai. You will learn about raster vs vector, resolution, PPI, and different image types, and more!
- The target audience for this tutorial would be beginners to digital art, or current artists wanting to know a little bit more about the settings of Paint Tool Sai as a program. It is a very beginner-friendly program. I started doing digital art when I was 13, so any young artist or someone just wanting to try it for the first time can pick it up.
