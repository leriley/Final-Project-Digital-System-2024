## About Paint Tool Sai
Paint Tool Sai is a graphics editor, comparable to Photoshop, mainly used for creating digital artwork. It is lightweight but has very powerful tools. Check out the website [here](https://www.systemax.jp/en/sai/). I am using Sai 2.  
### Tools for Drawing With
Along with a drawing program, you'll want a graphics tablet. A graphics tablet is a pressure-sentitive pad that allows you to hand-draw images with a stylus. The tablet I use at the moment is by [wacom](https://www.wacom.com/en-us).  


  
I have tried out many art programs over the years, but Sai has always been the best and easiest for me due to its simplicity and it being so intuitive. 
The vector lineart function is, in my opinion, the most powerful tool available, and unmatched in any other graphics software. 
Here's a short list of functions I prefer in Sai versus other various art programs. Not everyone will agree with all of this, but these are the reasons why I still use Sai after around 14 years of trying art programs: 

  ### Paint Tool Sai vs Procreate
  - I feel that Sai's selection tool is "smarter" than that of Procreate. No need to adjust the selection radius, but if you want to, there are multiple selection modes to choose from and each has a sensitivity slider. I always end up with gaps and crunchy edges when using the Procreate magic wand, and I find adjusting the selection to be annoying. Sai also has a selection pen and deselection pen that acts exactly like a regular brush.
  - No annoying animation when flipping the canvas
  - The ability to add clipping layers to groups! My workflow entierly depends on this feature, which Procreate lacks
  - Stabilizer settings that appy to every brush, and to me, just work better in general

### Paint Tool Sai vs Photoshop
- Sai is much more beginner-friendly. Simple and straight forward interface, and it's super easy to explore and find all the tools and effects. Photoshop is super advanced, and 99% of its features I don't need!
- Sai is most focused on drawing rather than Photoshop which I feel is a photo editor first
- Sai's linework features are much better suited for the artist, although they are very simple so they may not be what everyone is looking for

### Paint Tool Sai vs Fire Alpaca
- Once again, Sai's selection tools are superior to Fire Alpaca's. I always had bad aliasing with FA, which I never struggled with in Sai.
- Last I used it, there were no vector tools that I could find/use, but I haven't checked in a while; this may have changed.

### Paint Tool Sai vs Clip Studio Paint
- Clip Studio is one of the programs that, for me, holds a candle to Sai
- Sai's vector lineart tools still win, but Clip Studio is 2nd best in the market for this function
- Clip Studio also has a ton of other cool features Sai doesn't have!
