### Tools
One of my favorite tools that sets Sai apart from other programs is the *linework layer*. First, let's learn the difference between vector and raster graphics:
#### Raster
Raster images are made up of **pixels** and are resolution dependent. Because of this, they lose quality when enlarged. When you increase the size of a raster image, new pixels have to be created to fill the space. This can cause it to look blurry.
#### Vector
Vector, on the other hand, are rendered with mathematical formulas. This allows you to scale up vector images and they won't lose quality.
