Now, let's go over the process to see how all these elements work together, and see how digital drawings are finished and exported into digital images.  
### The Canvas
First thing I do is go to File/New and create a new canvas that's 3000x3000 pixels and 300 pixels/inch, with a white transparent background.

### The Sketch
I grab a custom brush I've made: a low opacity pen, and start sketching. Sometimes I'll create new layers underneath my sketch layer to play with how I want the colors to look. Make sure it's a decent size and that you're not too zoomed in. You can always shrink the image but making it bigger will be problematic. Here's the sketch for our little alien friend.

### Lineart
Now I create a Linework Layer and get to work on the lineart. I'll usually do the lines for the eyes on a separate layer from the body. In this case I also made his antenna on their own layer as well. Body lines are underneath the eyes lines, and the antenna lines are on on top of the others.
