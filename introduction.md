# Introduction to the Canvas
Now that the canvas has been created with your chosen [settings](settings.md), let's learn about the features here that allow us to create art. On the side of the screen is the interface. Which side this interface is on can be changed by going to the Window option at the top of the screen. Different parts of the interface can be moved to different sides. Mine are all kept together on the left. I'll be going over the interface in this order:

## 1: Navigation
Here is an overall view of your full canvas. This will locate your display relative to the canvas, and locate the center of your view. Grabbing and dragging the box will allow you to pan your view across the canvas space. Underneath the canvas view are two sliders: Scale and Angle. The scale option controls the zoom. As well as adjusting the slider, the **plus** and **minus** buttons next to the scale option will zoom in and zoom out. The **square** button will reset the view. The scroll wheel also allows you to zoom in and out. The angle slider and buttons allow you to "spin" your camera view. I usually navigate my workspace by zooming out, positioning my cursor where I want to pan to, and then zooming in on that location.
  
More view controls are also available at the top of your canvas; I use these more often.

The dropdown will allow you to pick preset zooms and angles. In addition to this, the button with opposite facing arrows is the **Flip Canvas** button. The stabilizer will slow down your pen strokes for smooth drawing. The slash button will switch to straight line drawing mode.

## 2: The Color Wheel 
Let's talk about how colors work in the digital world. Different colors are created by mixing **red, green, and blue** light at different intensities from ranges between 0 to 255. The color wheel conviniently gives you the ability to change the red, green, and blue content, as well as the saturation and brightness all in one. If this is too much power for you to handle, the buttons located above the color wheel give us more options for mixing colors. This is what the other palette options look like:  

And here you can see that 255 range between the RGB colors. Try playing with the sliders and inputting different numbers to see how the color changes.
