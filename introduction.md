# Introduction to the Canvas
Now that the canvas has been created with your chosen [settings](settings.md), let's learn about the features here that allow us to create art. On the side of the screen is the interface. Which side this interface is on can be changed by going to the Window option at the top of the screen. Different parts of the interface can be moved to different sides. Mine are all kept together on the left. I'll be going over the interface in this order:

## 1: Navigation
Here is an overall view of your full canvas. This will locate your display relative to the canvas, and locate the center of your view. Grabbing and dragging the box will allow you to pan your view across the canvas space. Underneath the canvas view are two sliders: Scale and Angle. The scale option controls the zoom. As well as adjusting the slider, the **plus** and **minus** buttons next to the scale option will zoom in and zoom out. The **square** button will reset the view. The scroll wheel also allows you to zoom in and out.  
The angle slider and buttons allow you to "spin" your camera view.
