## Settings for Digital Art
Now that we have Paint Tool Sai, let's learn about how to set up a canvas. There are specific settings you want to have in order to create quality art. To start setting up your canvas, hit File/New in the upper left-hand corner, or press **Ctrl+N**. You'll be greeted with a prompt for setting up your new canvas. Let's go over some of these settings:

##Resolution

## Dots Per Inch, or DPI
DPI is the number of *dots* per 1 inch. For things that are "within arm's reach," such as stickers, t-shirts, posters, or greeting cards, **300 DPI is the standard**. So if you're an artist and you want to
create little products like this with your art, you **need to be using 300 DPI**. This will provide a resolution that is sharp and high quality. The higher the DPI, the more detail available for the image.
If you were printing for a billboard for example, this doesn't need small details to fit into each inch of space on that image. How much detail do you need in a gigantic image that everyone is viewing
from afar? In this case, details are unnecessary, so you can go much lower in DPI.
