## Settings for Digital Art
Now that we have Paint Tool Sai, let's learn about how to set up a canvas. There are specific settings you want to have in order to create quality art. To start setting up your canvas, hit File/New in the upper left-hand corner, or press **Ctrl+N**. You'll be greeted with a prompt for setting up your new canvas. Let's go over some of these settings:

| Setting    | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| File Name  | This will be the name of your working canvas and what the file will be saved as|
| Preset | Sai has presets for common resolutions, such as A4 or B5 |
| Width/Height    | The number of pixels long or tall your canvas will be. The unit of measurement can be changed as well     |
| Printing Resolution | 

## Resolution

## Dots Per Inch, or DPI
DPI is the number of *dots* per 1 inch. For things that are "within arm's reach," such as stickers, t-shirts, posters, or greeting cards, **300 DPI is the standard**. So if you're an artist and you want to
create little products like this with your art, you **need to be using 300 DPI**. This will provide a resolution that is sharp and high quality. The higher the DPI, the more detail available for the image.
If you were printing for a billboard for example, this doesn't need small details to fit into each inch of space on that image. How much detail do you need in a gigantic image that everyone is viewing
from afar? In this case, details are unnecessary, so you can go much lower in DPI.
