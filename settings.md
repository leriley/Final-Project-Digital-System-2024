## Settings for Digital Art
Now that we have Paint Tool Sai, let's learn about how to set up a canvas. There are specific settings you want to have in order to create quality art. To start setting up your canvas, hit File/New in the upper left-hand corner, or press **Ctrl+N**. You'll be greeted with a prompt for setting up your new canvas. Let's go over some of these settings:

| File Name  | This will be the name of your working canvas and what the file will be saved as|
| Preset | Sai has presets for common resolutions, such as A4 or B5 |
| Width/Height    | The number of pixels long or tall your canvas will be. The unit of measurement can be changed as well     |
| Printing Resolution | 300 is the industry standard that you want to use when creating digital art suitable for print (stickers, bookmarks, etc). Learn more about PPI and DPI [here](https://99designs.com/blog/tips/ppi-vs-dpi-whats-the-difference/)
